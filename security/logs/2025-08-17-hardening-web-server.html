  <h1>2025-08-17 — Hardening web server</h1>
  <p><time>2025-08-17 16:45</time> • Before putting the site online we locked down the server with <code>ufw</code>. Only ports 80 and 443 were opened for web traffic, and SSH was limited. This cut off unnecessary services from being exposed and gave us a cleaner, safer baseline to build on.</p>
